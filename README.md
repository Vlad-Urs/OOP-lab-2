# Lab 2: Spaceship captain simulator

This simulation should provide the experience of managing a spaceship on long coyage through the empty space.

The objects that make the ship diverge in 2 main categories. 
There are the hardware parts of the ship:
* The reactor: the beating heart of the ship, provides energy and power for moving forward and surving the journey. However it can overheat and explode in a nuclear meltdown and destroy the whole ship.
* The engines: powered by the reactor, they thrust the ship forward, and work depending on their condition. If they slow down, the journey will take longer
* The shield: protects the ship from random space debris and invaders
* The hull: the outer shell of the ship, if it is broken and not patched quickly, the humans will die
* The Guns: they help protecting the ship from invaders
* Life Support: the system that keeps humans alive, providing them with vitals such as oxygen and food. Naturally, if it breaks down, the humns die as well.

Next there are the human components of the ship:
* The Engineers: they are in charge of repairing and maintaning the ship's hardware. Perhaps the most important team on deck.
* The medical team: treats any injuries or illnesses on board.
* The Crew: the team in the cockpit, ensures the smooth trajectory of the ship.
* The Passengers: the main cargo of the ship. No technical advantages, they just get sick and revolt from time to time.
* The Security team: protect the ship from invaders and ensure order in case of mutinies and revolts inside the ship.
